"""Access-control policy for the feedback-stats endpoint.

The handler no longer gates on admin: access is governed by the global role
allowlist (`enforce_role_allowlist`). Since the staff-role split, feedback-stats
is one of the six read-only ops dashboards reserved for `staff` (and `admin`) —
a plain `user` can no longer reach it. The aggregation query is Postgres-specific
and cannot run against the SQLite test DB, so the policy is asserted at the
allowlist layer that runs before any SQL.
