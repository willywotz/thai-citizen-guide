"""Regression guard: the /mcp Streamable-HTTP app must be stateless.

Production runs uvicorn with `--workers 4` (see backend/Dockerfile). Stateful
MCP sessions store the session object in the worker process that handled the
`initialize` request. With no session affinity across workers, a follow-up
request carrying the `Mcp-Session-Id` can land on a different worker that has
never seen that session, which makes the MCP client raise an intermittent
"Session terminated" error.

Stateless mode (a fresh transport per request) removes the cross-worker
session dependency, so any worker can serve any request. FastMCP signals this
by dropping the GET SSE stream from the Streamable-HTTP route: stateless routes
accept only POST/DELETE, never GET.
