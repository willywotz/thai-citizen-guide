"""Regression guard: the MCP SSE transport is NOT exposed.

The legacy OneChat-spec SSE transport (GET /sse + POST /messages/) was removed.
It drove the raw MCP SDK server over SseServerTransport, which is inherently
session-affine: the open stream lives in one process, so it cannot survive the
production `uvicorn --workers 4` deployment and cannot be made stateless like
the /mcp Streamable-HTTP app. Clients use /mcp instead.

This test fails if anyone re-adds the SSE routes, prompting a deliberate
decision rather than silently reintroducing a worker-fragile surface.
