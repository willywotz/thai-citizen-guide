"""Pins the exact surface reachable by `user` and anonymous callers.

This test is the safety net for the five-roles-to-two refactor. It must pass
identically before and after. A diff here means the refactor changed someone's
access, which the design explicitly forbids.

It walks the real route table instead of a hand-written path list so a route
nobody remembered is still covered.
